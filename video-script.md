- exploration: left-wall following
- state map
- call for alignment whenever possible

- ~~A* to unexplored area~~
- fastest path: A*
- map display can be accessed through multiple devices

~~after finishing the left-wall following exploration, if there are still unexplored grid, we will use A* algorithm to reach to that particular grid so we can achieve 100% for the exploration.~~

for the fastest path, we are using A* algorithm because it returns the most optimal path using minimum number of path cost.

in doing the map display, we set up a web server so that it can be displayed across multiple devices
