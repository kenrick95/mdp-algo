initialise start point and direction
set repeatedArea = 0
do
	get sensor data
	update exploration map
	Use algorithm & sensor data to decide turn left, right or go straight
		Include consideration if the path is explored or unexplored.
	if next cell is already explored then
		repeatedArea += 1
	Execute the movement (Update current position of robot)
	
	if repeatedArea = 15 then
		break
while (Not start point) and (exploration map < 100%)
Use Shortest path to return back to start point from current position
